This project is a Vite + React + TypeScript website for BLOM Cosmetics.  

Design + Styling rules:
- Always keep the brand’s look: modern, elegant, pastel gradients (light blue #CEE5FF, pink #FF74A4) and rounded corners.  
- Reuse existing buttons, fonts, and spacing so new components match the site’s vibe. Fonts should stay consistent across pages (inherit global body font).  
- Never overwrite or break existing global CSS. When adding new styles, namespace them with `.home-newsletter`, `.myc`, etc. to avoid conflicts.  
- Use smooth, minimal animations and avoid unnecessary complexity.  
- All assets come from `/public` (ex: `/public/logo.webp`).  and they all end with .webp
Structure rules:
- Header, Footer, and Announcement Bar should be shared layout components (no duplicate markup in pages).  
- Keep changes scoped: only edit relevant files, don’t touch unrelated sections.  
- Make sections responsive: two-column on desktop, stacked on mobile.  

General rule:
- Do not remove working functionality.  
- Do not add third-party libraries unless specifically asked.  
- Prioritize clean, token-efficient edits that don’t break existing layouts.
